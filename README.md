- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mw-jeong
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m a Masterâ€™s student in Data Science at KAIST.
- ðŸ‘€ My research focuses on spatial-temporal data mining and graph neural networks to address challenges in urban contexts, including Human Mobility and Urban Air Mobility. I am particularly interested in Next Location Prediction and understanding user behavior to develop data-driven solutions that optimize MaaS and enhance user experiences.
